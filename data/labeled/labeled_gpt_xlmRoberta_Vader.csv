0,vfb,Alexander N√ºbel,"Silas fehlt halt enorm. Das hat man gerade gegen Real gesehen. Der h√§tte mindestens ein Tor gemacht, wenn er so viel Raum zur Verf√ºgung gehabt h√§tte. Leweling konnte ja auch frei aufspielen, da er so viel Platz, wie in vielen Bundesliga-Spielen nicht, von Real einger√§umt bekommen hat. Die andere Sache ist halt, dass N√ºbel in jedem Spiel f√ºr ein oder zwei Patzer gut ist.
